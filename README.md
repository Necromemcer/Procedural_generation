# My Endeavors in Procedural Generation and Emergent Behavior

## 1. Bacterial World

This project aims to simulate a bacterial environment where bacteria exhibit dynamic genotype-to-phenotype relations and complex behaviors. The simulation is designed to be modular, allowing for easy extension and customization.

### Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps (Python is required):

1. Clone the repository (or simply download the file manually):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Necromemcer/Procedural_generation.git
    cd Procedural_generation

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Execute the file:
    ```bash
    python bacterial_world.py
